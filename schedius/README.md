# Schedius

This little program should create images of lines, squares, circles and other more complex geometric shapes to pass an idea
through an image. Say you're talking about knowledge exploration in terms of graphs (the mathematical construct or data structure).
It would be nice to actually be able to easily build an image of a graph, right? This program tries to solve that and remain simple
at the same time. Since I want things to remain simple, ideally you shouldn't have to mess with the position of your shapes, text 
and whatnot explicitly. The same goes for how your graphs or trees are laid out. This program is supposed to create rough sketches,
it is not to be used to draw anything in a proper and correct manner, but only to be used as visual aid when necessary. 

It's a pain to have to actually use my mouse to draw stuff like that...
