# Synthesis

This is a repository containing my ongoing experiments with sound synthesis.

## Goals

* TO EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE OF SOUND THROUGH COMPUTER PROGRAMMING

## Prototype 1

[synthesis/prototype_1](https://github.com/adonaac/synthesis/tree/master/prototype_1) was created as a project for 
a class on programming and music. It was developed with [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org/) and
is my first attempt at synthesizing sounds with a computer! It was supposed to be a clone of [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
(browser version [here](http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/)) but it turned out to be a rather buggy and inferior one. ;_;
