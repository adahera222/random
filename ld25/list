Things to do (in order of importance):

    Transitions (kill rooms, "movies", ...)
    Level loading and displaying
    Rectangle collision
    Entity movement
    Camera
    Entity behavior (flee)
    Gun (projectiles, enemy hit)

    Rectangle collision: (done, 15/12/2012 04:10)

    Entity movement: (done, 15/12/2012 06:00)
        Create entity class (id, position, width, height, ...)
        Create movement code (acceleration, velocity only for player)
        Create input code (mixin? should be switchable for AI)
        Jump!

    Level loading and displaying: (done, 15/12/2012 01:58)
        For each level:
            Create a level file (tiles)
            Load level in a level class which holds all tiles and entities
            Level class updates entities, collides them with tiles, etc...
       
    Transitions: (done, 15/12/2012 01:19) 
        Each scene is a different level 
        Transitions between levels:
            Receive transition message
            Current level = get level specified in the message from list of levels
            Each level has its end condition and so the message is sent
